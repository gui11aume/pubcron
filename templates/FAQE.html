  <h1>What is the difference between a FAQ and a FAQ(E)?</h1>
  A FAQ aims at answering users' frequently asked questions,
  while a FAQ(E) is quite the opposite. It looks like a FAQ
  in the question-answer format, but the questions are carefully
  chosen by the developers to emphasize the strengths of their
  product.

  <h1>What does FAQ(E) stand for?</h1>
  Well, honestly... I don't know.

  <h1>What does PubCron do?</h1>
  PubCron retrieves new PubMed abstracts matching your personal
  query, sorts them by relevance and sends them to you by mail.

  <h1>How does that differ from PubCrawler?</h1>
  Well, not so much really. Mostly, it's the Linux penguin in the
  title bar of PubCrawler...
  Not that I have anything against penguins by the way.
  Still, if you're a penguin type of person, you should definitely
  check out
  <a href="http://pubcrawler.gen.tcd.ie/">PubCrawler</a>.

  <h1>Is PubCron open source?</h1>
  Yes. You can get the source code from
  <a href="https://github.com/gui11aume/pubcron">github</a>.

  <h1>What do I need to use PubCron?</h1>
  You need a Google account. This is how your identity is
  recorded by PubCron. This also defines the email address
  where the results will be sent to.

  <h1>How can I unsubscribe from PubCron?</h1>
  Fill in an empty query on your PubCron's
  <a href="query.html">query</a> page.

  <h1>How can I send relevance feedback?</h1>
  You have to do it from the PubCron mails. You can specify whether
  an abstract is relevant or not with the radio buttons after the text.
  Check "No answer" if you do not want to give relevance feedback for
  a particular abstract. Then press one of the "Send feedback" buttons
  at the beginning or the end of the mail. Note that sending the
  information from your mail client to PubCron will trigger a warning.

  <h1>What do the numbers next to the abstract title mean?</h1>
  This is the abstract relevance score. If you never sent any
  feedback, they should all be 0. Otherwise, they tell you  how the
  given text matches the abstracts you find relevant. A negative
  score means that the text is closer to the abstracts you marked
  as irrelevant than the ones you marked as relevant.

  <h1>Do I have to send feedback for all articles?</h1>
  Actually you do not have to send feedback at all.
  But the abstracts will come in a random order. This can
  be a problem as PubCron has a limit on the number of abstracts
  sent in each mail (currently 40). If your query returned more
  than 40 articles, some particularly relevant hits can be lost.

  <h1>Why do I receive at most 40 articles?</h1>
  Hands-on experience showed that the top 40 hits usually contain
  the most interesting abstracts. And also, without this limit the
  PubCron mail can become so large that you cannot display it in full.

  <h1>Why do I get a warning message in the PubCron mail?</h1>
  PubCron is a free application powered by
  <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>.
  In order to stay within the limits of the quotas on traffic and
  computer power, PubCron has a limit on the articles it retrieves
  from PubMed (currently 200). If your query routinely returns
  more than this number of hits, some articles will be ignored
  (<i>i.e.</i> they will not be ranked and not be returned in the
  PubCron mail). To avoid this, make sure your query is focused
  and does not return too many hits.

  <h1>I gave relevance feedback. Why articles still have a score
  of 0.0?</h1>
  You probably gave feedback for relevant articles only. PubCron
  can compute a relevance score only if you also give feedback for
  irrelevant articles.
