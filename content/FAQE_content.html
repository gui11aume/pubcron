<h1>PubCron FAQ(E)</h1>

<h2>What is the difference between a FAQ and a FAQ(E)?</h2>
<p>A FAQ aims at answering users' frequently asked questions,
while a FAQ(E) is quite the opposite. It looks like a FAQ
in the question-answer format, but the questions are carefully
chosen by the developers to emphasize the strengths of their
product.</p>

<h2>What does FAQ(E) stand for?</h2>
<p>Well, honestly... no idea.</p>

<h2>What does PubCron do?</h2>
<p>PubCron retrieves new PubMed abstracts matching your personal
query, sorts them by relevance and sends them to you by mail.</p>

<h2>How does that differ from PubCrawler?</h2>
<p>Well, not so much really. I guess the Linux penguin in the
title bar...</p>

<h2>Is PubCron open source?</h2>
<p>Yes. You can get the source code from
<a href="https://github.com/gui11aume/pubcron">Github</a>.</p>

<h2>What do I need to use PubCron?</h2>
<p>You need a Google account. This is how your identity is
recorded by PubCron. This also defines the email address
where the results will be sent to.</p>

<h2>How can I unsubscribe to PubCron?</h2>
<p>Fill in an empty query on your PubCron's
<a href="query.html">query</a> page.</p>

<h2>How can I send relevance feedback?</h2>
<p>You have to do it from the PubCron mails that you receive
at your Google account email address. You can specify whether each
abstract is relevant or not with the radio buttons after the text.
Check "No answer" if you do not want to give relevance feedback for
a particular abstract. Then press one of the "Send feedback" buttons
at the beginning and the end of the mail. Note that sending the
information from your mail client to PubCron will trigger a warning.
</p>

<h2>What do the numbers next to abstract title mean?</h2>
<p>This is the abstract relevance score. If you never sent any
feedback, they should all be 0. Otherwise, they tell you  how the
given text resembles the abstracts you find relevant. A negative
score means that the text is closer to the abstracts you marked
as irrelevant than the ones you marked as relevant.</p>

<h2>Do I have to send feedback for all articles?</h2>
<p>Actually you do not have to send feedback at all.
But the abstracts will come in a random order. This can
be a problem as PubCron has a limit on the number of abstracts
sent in each mail (currently 40). If your query returned more
than 40 articles, some particularly relevant hits can be lost.</p>

<h2>Why do I receive at most 40 articles?</h2>
<p>Hands-on experience showed that the top 40 hits usually contain
the most interesting abstracts. And also, without this limit the
PubCron mail can become so large that you cannot display it in full.
</p>

<h2>Why do I get a warning message in the PubCron mail?</h2>
<p>PubCron is a free application powered by
<a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>.
In order to stay within the limits of the quotas on traffic and
computer power, PubCron has a limit on the articles it retrieves
from PubMed (currently 200). If your query routinely returns
more than this number of hits, some articles will be ignored
(<i>i.e.</i> they will not be ranked and not be returned in the
PubCron mail). To avoid this, make sure your query is focused
and does not return too many hits.</p>

<h2>My question was not in the list, what can I do?</h2>
<p>You can write to the PubCron mailer (reply to any of the PubCron
mails).</p>
