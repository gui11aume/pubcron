<h1>PubCron Help</h1>

<p style="margin-top:2em;">To use PubCron, you need to have a
<a href="https://accounts.google.com/NewAccount">Google</a> account
with a valid address. PubCron is powered by
<a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>,
which takes care of data storage and Internet security issues. In
addition, the PubCron mail display is optimized for Gmail.
If you want the PubCron mail to be sent to another address, you
will have to set up a mail forwarding.</p>

<p>Then, you have to fill in a valid PubMed query. The specified
term will be queried every day and the hits will be sent to
your address. PubMed queries have their specific syntax which is
explained <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3827/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>PubCron allows you to give relevance feedback, so that it learns
your interests and ranks them higher in the future. The
articles with the highest relevance score will appear first in
the PubCron mail.</p>


<p>PubCron is <b>free</b> and <b>open source</b>. It is written in
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> and
the code is available at
<a href="https://github.com/gui11aume/pubcron">Github</a>.
