PubCron allows users to set up a cron task that routinely performs a PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) query and sends them the abstracts by mail. Users can give relevance feedback from the mail to fine-tune their query.

PubCron is deployed at http://pubcron.appspot.com on Google App Engine.
